## Current Sprint

**Active Phase**: Phase 12 - Deployment & SSR
**Current Step**: 12.3 - Environment & Deployment Config

**Phases 1-11 Complete! ðŸŽ‰**
**Steps 12.1 & 12.2 Complete! ðŸŽ‰**

**Phase 12.1 Completion Notes:**
- âœ… Cloudflare Pages Function for SSR at `/b/:shareToken`
- âœ… OG/Twitter meta tags with board name, description, and image URL
- âœ… ETag caching (24h) based on `boards.updated_at`
- âœ… Auto-detects built asset paths (CSS/JS)
- âœ… Fixed RPC response structure and schema validation
- âœ… Tested with both Wrangler dev and normal dev server

**Phase 12.2 Completion Notes:**
- âœ… Database migration: added `og_image_id` column to boards table
- âœ… Updated `get_public_board` RPC to include `og_image_id`
- âœ… Created OG image proxy endpoint at `/api/og/:shareToken.png`
- âœ… Logic: uses designated OG image if set, falls back to first image
- âœ… Updated schemas to include `og_image_id` field
- âœ… Built UI component `SetOgImageDialog` for selecting OG preview image
- âœ… Integrated dialog into BoardPageHeader with "Preview Image" button
- âœ… Fixed PostgREST embedding conflict with foreign key hints (`!images_board_id_fkey`)
- âœ… Users can now select which board image appears in social media previews

**Next Up**:

1. Environment & Deployment Configuration for Cloudflare Pages production deployment

**Deployment Reminder**:

- [ ] When deploying to Cloudflare Pages, update Google OAuth authorized JavaScript origins to include production domain
