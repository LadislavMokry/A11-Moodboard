## Test Assignment – Mini Moodboard

Build a simple web app where users can create personal moodboards and save images into them. Think of it as a very light version of [_Savee_](https://savee.com/) or [_Mymind_](https://mymind.com/) focused only on collecting and displaying images.

### 🔑 Core Features

1. **Authentication**
   - Implement Google login/signup using Supabase Auth.
2. **Moodboards**
   - A user can create a new moodboard (give it a name and short description).
   - Each moodboard displays images in a grid layout (good reference is [savee.com](http://www.savee.com))
   - Each moodboard should like a like folder on initial page with 4 thumbnails what’s inside
   - Eeach moodboard should be stored in DB with own metadata and content
3. **Image Upload**
   - A user can add an image (drag’n drop area to upload or by button Upload ).
   - Images should be stored in Supabase storage and then displayed in the grid.
4. **Frontend**
   - Clean and simple UI (Next.js + Tailwind recommended).
   - Focus on usability and minimalistic design.

### ⭐ Bonus Points

- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- Delete images or rename a moodboard.
- 🎨 **Design sense & animations** → extra points for nice visual style, polish, or small animations that make the app feel alive.

---

### ⏱ Time Expectation

- Aim for something you can complete in **6–8 hours**.
- It doesn’t have to be perfect or production-ready. The goal is to see how you approach building and shipping.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

- A **live deployed link** (Vercel/Netlify) where we can try the app.
- (Optional) A **GitHub repo** with the code.
- A short **README**:
  - what stack you used,
  - what was done manually vs. with AI,
  - any challenges you faced.

---

### 🧮 What we will evaluate

- **Functionality** – does the app work (auth → create → upload → display)?
- **Design/UX** – does it look clean and usable? Bonus points for design feeling & animations.
- **AI usage** – how effectively you used AI in your workflow.
- **Deployment** – can we open the link and use the app right away?
