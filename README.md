🎨 Moodeight

A simple web app where users can create personal moodboards, upload images, and organize them in a clean, responsive interface. Built as a Vibe Coder test assignment, the focus was on functionality, clean UI, and a smooth user experience.

🛠️ Stack & Deployment

React + Vite → lightweight, fast, modern frontend stack

TailwindCSS → utility-first styling for responsive design and quick iteration

Supabase → Google authentication, database storage for moodboards, and file storage for images

Cloudflare Pages → chosen for deployment. I’ve worked with Vercel and Netlify, but I prefer Cloudflare since it feels more polished in production and avoids the vendor lock-in concerns often raised about Vercel/Next.js.

This stack also matches the defaults in modern AI-powered coding tools (Replit, Lovable, Bolt.dev), making it a natural fit for my workflow.

🤖 Manual vs. AI Work

Every line of code was generated by AI. My role was acting as the conductor of the AI orchestra:

Defining the app’s structure, features, and UX goals

Directing AI tools to produce components, Supabase queries, and Tailwind layouts

Doing the wiring work: integrating Supabase, refining drag-and-drop, and deploying to Cloudflare

Iterating on design ideas and ensuring the result felt cohesive and usable

This approach let me move fast while keeping focus on architecture, problem-solving, and polish.

⚡ Challenges

The main issues were around balancing design polish with technical constraints:

Board layout + drag & drop → keeping the grid visually pleasant while ensuring images could be reordered smoothly

Waterfall effect on homepage → creating Savee-style previews with 4-image thumbnails for each moodboard

Wide image handling → making wide images span two columns while preserving the drag & drop reordering logic

Solving these required iterating through different grid systems and fine-tuning drag-and-drop behaviors until the UX felt right.
